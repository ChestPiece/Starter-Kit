## 💻 **Technical Implementation:**

### **Components Enhanced:**

```

✅ app/(main)/settings/page.tsx - Role-based settings access
✅ app/(main)/users/page.tsx - Already existed, enhanced with permissions
✅ components/(main)/user/index.tsx - Added access controls and role UI
✅ components/main-layout/menu-items.tsx - Dynamic navigation by role
✅ components/main-layout/app-sidebar.tsx - Role-aware sidebar
```

### **Role System Integration:**

```
✅ UserRoles enum (admin, manager, user)
✅ Database functions (is_admin(), is_manager(), get_user_role())
✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
✅ Permission checking helpers
✅ Role hierarchy enforcement
```

### **Access Control Patterns:**

```typescript
// Role checking example used throughout
const isAdmin = user?.roles?.name === UserRoles.ADMIN;
const isManager = user?.roles?.name === UserRoles.MANAGER || isAdmin;

// Component-level access control
if (!isManager) {
  return <AccessDeniedCard />;
}

// Feature-level restrictions
{isAdmin && <AdminOnlyFeature />}
{isManager && <ManagerFeature />}
```
